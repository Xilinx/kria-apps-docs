The Built-In Self Test (BIST) application tests the interfaces on Kria starter kits to verify functionality and/or performance. If a custom design is not working as expected, this application can be used to differentiate hardware issues from design issues.

The BIST application is based on the pytest framework and designed to be modular and configurable so that it can be used across different starter kits. The tests are grouped into modules based on the interface which allows testing individual interfaces if needed. Some tests are self-validating tests, while others require user input based on observation. Each individual test either verifies the functionality or performance of an interface.
