# Kria SOM Ubuntu Support

## Ubuntu

In addition to the PetaLinux and Yocto enablement Kria KV260 has a certified [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/2037317633/Getting+Started+with+Certified+Ubuntu+20.04+LTS+for+Xilinx+Devices) image which can be found at this [Ubuntu site](https://ubuntu.com/download/xilinx). The [Getting Started Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria/kv260-vision-starter-kit/kv260-getting-started/getting-started.html) provides a tutorial on how to use the provided Ubuntu image on the KV260 Starter Kit including running the NLP SmartVision application. NOTE: Of the KV260 applications available only the NLP-smartvision application has been ported for out-of-box support in the Ubuntu image.

## PYNQ

PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx® that makes it easier to use Xilinx platforms by leveraging the Python and Jupyter ecosystems. It can be readily installed on the KV260 running Ubuntu and includes four open-source designs. PYNQ brings Dynamic Function eXchange (DFX) capabilities, in the form of composable overlays, to Kria SOMs so users can create their own custom data pipelines at runtime directly within the PYNQ environment without using additional development tools – time-multiplexing partial or full hardware designs is easier than ever.
