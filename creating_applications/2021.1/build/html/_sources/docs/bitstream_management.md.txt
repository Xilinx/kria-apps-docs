# Bitstream Management on Kria SOM

Kria SOM Linux-based work flow load bitstream post Linux boot. It also uses xmutil with dfx-manager under the hood to manage bitstreams. There are some differences between legacy MPSoC bitstream management vs Kria SOM bitstream management.

The following diagram summarizes the difference, and the table details the difference. Also refer to the

| Topic | Legacy MPSoC Flow | Kria SOM Flow |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Bitstream Management | Majority of previous MPSoC examples focused on bitstream being loaded at time of Linux boot and maintaining a static HW/SW interface from booting Linux through running applications. This means that the bistream is loaded prior to Linux booting and its device tree was loaded as part of the Linux boot device tree.                   | The Kria Starter Kit focuses on dynamic post-Linux boot bitstream management. This enables an application-agnostic boot FW that does not include any bitstream. The bitstream is instead managed within the Linux file system and swapped dynamically at runtime using xmutil/dfx-mgr. The loading of the bitstream needs to be accompanied by its HW/SW interface definition which is appended to the booted Linux device tree (DT) through a Linux DT-overlay.  Thus bitstreams being managed dynamically require both the bitstream (`*.bit.bin`) and DT-overlay (`*.dtbo`) files. The [on target utility](./target.md) has information and pointers to bitstream management by xmutil/dfx-mgr |
| Bitstream Generation | Majority of MPSoC legacy examples focused on generation of the MPSoC device configuration (e.g. PCW MIO configs) and the PL bitstream as a monolithic configuration generation. This was then used to generate entire set of boot FW artifacts (FSBL, PL, PMU, ...) with every build.  | Kria Starter Kit focuses on an incremental HW configuration. This means that at the time of a new PL design, the user only needs to generate the new bitstream (within the constraints of not changing other device configurations such as MIO assignments) and do not need to re-generate an entirely new BOOT.BIN. User will use the resulting bitstream file and generate a corresponding DT overlay, both of which are later copied to the Linux file system to be loaded by xmutil/dfx-mgr. |
| Boot Segmentation    | Legacy MPSoC examples focus on a monolithic boot device (e.g. QSPI or SD card or eMMC). In this flow all FW content is managed and searched by CSU ROM within the same physical device.                                                                                                | Kria Starter Kit uses a primary/secondary boot architecture to functionally segment the core boot FW from the OS image. They are detailed in [BootFW](https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/bootfw/build/html/docs/bootfw_overview.html) page. The QSPI device serves as the primary boot device containing the platform BOOT.BIN which contains FSBL, PMU FW, and U-Boot. The SD card device serves as the secondary boot device containing the Linux OS artifacts include the kernel and rootfs. This allows for the platform to boot multiple Linux OS images without a user having to build or modify the core boot FW. A user can update the boot FW of QSPI with their own custom BOOT.BIN, and do this using the xmutil boot image update utility. U-Boot is used to support the hand-off between QSPI and the SD card based secondary boot device.  (See K26 SOM XSA & BSP Overview for reference) |
| Dynamic MIO          | Legacy MPSoC designs used a static MIO configuration which locks in the configuration of the PS subsystem physical I/O at device boot time.                 | The Kria Starter Kit references use an incremental HW configuration capability of PMU in order to support dynamic configuration of carrier card specific MIO (KV260 vs. KR260). This allows for a common boot FW which identifies the carrier card via the BoardID EEPROM and then U-Boot incrementally configures the corresponding CC card specific MIOs.                       |
