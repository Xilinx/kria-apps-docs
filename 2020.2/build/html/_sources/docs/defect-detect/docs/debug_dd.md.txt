# Debugging

This document lists some debugging tips for the Defect Detection application.

* Make sure you that you use:

  `sudo xmutil loadapp kv260-defect-detect`

  to load the **defect-detect** firmware properly. Otherwise, necessary drivers will not be loaded, and there will be many errors that pop up when you run the **defect-detect** application.

* Always unload existing firmware before loading the **defect-detect** firmware.
