# Hardware Architecture of the Platform

## Introduction

 This section describes the hardware block design components implemented in Programmable Logic (PL).

 The PL design read data from the PMOD GPS Receiver to get the GPS time from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The platform uses AXI UART Lite IP to interface with the PMOD Receiver's UART interface for getting the GPS data in NMEA format. The 1PPS signal from the PMOD receiver is connected to PS GPIO via EMIO pins. Gigabit Ethernet MAC (GEM) Controller (GEM0,GEM1) is enabled in the PS to transmit, receive PTP packets or ethernet traffic. 
 
 The following figure shows the top-level hardware architecture of the reference design.

### PMOD GPS Receiver

The following figure shows the PMOD GPS receiver

GPS receiver has 
1. UART interface : Provides GPS time and GPS Coordinate data in NMEA format. 
2. 1PPS output    : A pulse is sent out at every one second .

## AXI UART LITE

The LogiCORE™ IP AXI UART Lite core converts AXI4 Lite register transactions to RS232 signaling. PMOD GPS receiver provides GPS time and GPS Coordinate data in NMEA format using the embedded UART interface. AXI UART LITE IP has UART controller to read data from PMOD receiver and convert it into AXI4 Lite register transactions to be read by the PS.
