   Kria KR260 Robotics Starter Kit



The Kria KR260 Robotics Starter Kit is the latest out-of-the box ready evaluation/development platform in the Xilinx® `Kria <https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria.html>`_ portfolio of products. The Starter Kit is the platform of choice for development of robotics, machine vision, industrial communication & control target applications. It consists of a non-production K26 SOM plugged into a robotics carrier card and equipped with an active thermal solution of fan and heatsink. The SOM on the Starter Kit is based on `Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC <https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html>`_ EV architecture that is paired with 4 GB of DDR4 memory.

The KR260 Starter Kit is an instant-on robotics platform. It enables, hardware-accelerated applications and ROS 2 hardware accelerated packages for robotics with its Open Source Kria Robotics Stack (KRS) that make it easier for ROS 2 developers to build high-performance robots.

For a full-fledged robot KR260 Starter Kit provides all the interfaces commonly used in robotics for vision, sensing, networking, and I/O expansions.

Networking is paramount in robotics andKR260 provides multiple Ethernet interfaces for enabling traditional DDS-UDP based communication as well as ready-to-use IP in programmable logic for accurate time synchronization over Ethernet (IEEE 802.1AS) and state of the art Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocol by default even for the most demanding robotics applications.

Robotics and Machine Vision might require high performance vision sensors. Standard MIPI CSI-2/D-PHY interface may pose limitations with respect to bandwidth and distance. Kria KR260 Starter Kit provides the SLVS-EC standard connector for high-resolution and high-performance vision sensors.

Processing machine vision application with no loss of fidelity requires high-speed communication. An Ethernet 10G interface with an SFP+ cage  allow  10GigE vision protocol making the kit an ideal choice for  high performance machine vision application development. The 10G Ethernet interface can be used to support even high-performance communication for robotics as well like digital twins or cloud-based connectivity.

Multiple I/O expansion connectors  on the KR260 Starter Kit such as 4 Pmod 12-pin interfaces and 1 Raspberry Pi HAT with 26 I/Os allow users to plug-in their choice of peripherals, like Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), GPS sensor, brushless motor drivers, serial communication, actuators, ultrasound sensors, and many others, no limit to the developer ingenuity.

Should the KR260 Starter Kit be used with actuators, manipulators and gripper, developers can plug-in one or many Pmod RS485 adapters and drive such peripherals via built in Modbus protocol.

Equipped with 4 4 USB3.0/2.0 interfaces KRS260 enable easy connection to any USB peripheral being it USB stereo camera, Lidar, Radar, or any other USB device that is required by the user.

The DisplayPort 1.2a connector helps output video data on a DP-supported monitor and drive real-time video feed from cameras/sensors.

Security is a must for any robot and the KR260 Starter Kit sets a higher standard for security through the MPSoC hardware root of trust (RoT) and Infineon TPM2.0, making it one of the most secured platforms for robotics.

Enabled by a growing ecosystem of accelerated applications from the Xilinx App Store, developers of all types can get applications up and running in under 1 hour, with no FPGA experience needed. From there, customization and differentiation can be added via preferred design environments, at any level of abstraction—from application software to AI model to FPGA design.

ROS 2 Support
********************************************************

Developers benefit with greater flexibility from native ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill release with Ubuntu) support and increased productivity through the Kria Robotics Stack (KRS).KRS is an Open Source ROS 2 superset for industry, an integrated set of robot libraries and utilities to accelerate the development, maintenance and commercialization of industrial-grade robotic solutions while using adaptive computing. KRS provides to ROS 2 users an easy and robust path to hardware acceleration. It allows ROS 2 roboticists to create custom secure compute architectures with higher productivity. KRS leverages Xilinx technology targeting the Kria SOM portfolio to deliver low latency (real-fast), determinism (predictable), real-time (on-time), security and high throughput to robotics.

With both hardware and software development requirements simplified, the KR260 Robotics Starter Kit coupled with KRS is the fastest and easiest platform for application development with the goal of heading towards production volume deployment with the Kria K26 SOMs. The KR260 Robotics Starter Kit is very accessible and priced at $349, it is the perfect vehicle to leverage during the development phase of your innovative robotics applications and further accelerates your time to market.
