# Creating a Vitis Platform

## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to build a Platform for applications running on KR260 Robotics Starter Kit.

## Prerequisites

* Vitis Unified Software Platform of the appropiate version

### Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files

> **Note**: Skip the following steps if the design files have already been cloned and extracted to a working repository

1. To access the reference files, type the following into a terminal:

   ```shell
   git clone --branch xlnx_rel_v2022.1 --recursive https://github.com/Xilinx/kria-vitis-platforms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `kria-vitis-platforms/kr260-vitis` which is the working directory.

## Generating an Vitis Extensible platform

1. Go to the working directory

   ```shell
   cd $working_dir/
   ```

2. To build the platform, run the following command. The Makefile calls a lower level Makefile to generate a platform. If an XSA is not already available it builds that as well.

   ```shell
   make platform PFM=<platform_name>
   ```

   Applications and their corresponding platforms are listed in the table below

   |Application |Platform|
   |----|----|
   |ROS 2 Multi-Node Communications via TSN |kr260_tsn_rs485pmod|

3. The generated platform will be located at

   ```shell
   $working_dir/platforms/xilinx_<platform_name>_<version_number>
   ```

   The xpfm file in the above directory will be used as input when building the Vitis accelerator projects. It exposes all the essential Platform Interfaces like Clock, Interrupts, Master AXI interfaces and Slave AXI interfaces for the accelerator to connect to.

> **Note**: The software components (boot, smp_linux etc) in this platform are empty. The software components will be generated later when building Petalinux.
