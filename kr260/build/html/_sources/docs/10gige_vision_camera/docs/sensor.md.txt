## Overview of Sony IMX547 Sensor

The Sony IMX547 is a diagonal 8.8 mm (Type 1/1.8) CMOS active pixel, solid-state image sensor with a square pixel array and 5.10 M effective pixels. This image sensor contains a global shutter with variable charge-integration time and is part of the Pregius S active pixel-type CMOS image sensors. By stacking the signal processing on the back-illuminated type CMOS Image Sensor, it realizes small chip size and high sensitivity, whilst using the high picture quality global shutter pixel technology of Pregius.

## Overview of FSA (Framos Sensor Adapter) Module

The FSA (Framos Sensor Adapter) connects to the FSM (Framos Sensor Module) allowing with Sub-LVDS, SLVS, or SLVS-EC devices.

### Functional Blocks

- Signal routing
- Voltage generation for image sensor
- Power up sequence for image sensor

The following table shows the selection of Sensor Clock Source on FSA-FTx/A-V1:

| Position | Description                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| 1        | Clock Provided from FSA (Default) |
| 2        | External Clock 1 (MCLK0)          |
| 3        | External Clock 2 (MCLK1)          |

> ***Note***: The above clock setting is not applicable for FSM used along with KR260.

### PixelMate™ - Sub-LVDS, SLVS and SLVS-EC Pinout

This pinout scheme applies to all sensors that natively output image data using signals according to Sub-LVDS, SLVS, or SLVS-EC specification. This layout provides eight data lanes on the connector. Devices with SLVS and SLVS-EC share the same sensor package pins. Therefore, share the same connector pins.

The following table shows the position of each signal on the 60-pin connector in case the image sensor provides it. For further details, refer to the image sensor Datasheet.

> ***Note***: Lane number assignment is applied according to the SLVS numbering, which, in most cases, differs from the SLVS-EC lane numbering. Refer to the image sensor datasheet for correct SLVS-EC numbering.

The following table shows the general signal assignment that applies to all connections using PixelMate™.

| Pin #      | Type                                       | Signal             | Pin #      | Type                                       | Signal             |

## Overview of Framos SLVS-EC IP Core

The SLVS-EC interface standard has emerged as the high-speed interface for image sensors from Sony. SLVS-EC v2.0 interface throughput is up to 5 Gbps per lane at great signal integrity, which is double the times of previous SLVS-EC interface 1.2. Engineers developing solutions using AMD FPGAs and SoCs can take advantage of FRAMOS's SLVS-EC RX IP Core, Development Kit, and tested source code examples. Device builders and camera vendors can de-risk the design while reaping the benefits of Sony's latest high-speed interface.

### Key Benefits & Features

- Byte-to-pixel conversion for SLVS-EC v1.2 / v2.0

- De-risk integration, reduce time to market

- Reference implementation for evaluation and guidance

- Flexible Lane Support in one IP CoreSupport for all supported RAW bit-depths

- Error correction and ROI overlap support

- AXI4 communication and control

Internal Structure of the SLVS-EC RX IP Core:

![SLVS-EC_RX_IP Core](./media/image005.png)

The SLVS-EC RX IP Core processes the incoming deserialized SLVS-EC packets and outputs the reconstructed pixels on the Output Data Interface. In addition, depending on the core variant, IP Core performs error detection (CRC core variant) or error correction (ECC core variant) on payload data.

### Port Descriptions

The SLVS-EC RX IP Core ports are listed in the following table, where `LANE_NUM` represents the number of lanes.
