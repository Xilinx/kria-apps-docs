# Introduction

This document shows how to set up the board and run the aibox-reid application.

# Setting up the Board

1. Get the SD Card Image from [KV260 Vision AI Starter - Getting Started page](https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria/kv260-vision-starter-kit/kv260-getting-started/getting-started.html) and follow the instructions provided there to burn the SD card. Insert the SD card into slot at J11.

2. Hardware Setup:

    ![GitHub Logo](../../media/som-board.png)

    * Monitor:

      This application requires **4K** monitor, so that up to 4 channels of 1080p video could be displayed.

      Before booting the board, please connect the monitor to the board via either DP or HDMI port.

    * UART/JTAG interface:

      For interacting and seeing boot-time information, connect a USB debugger to the J4.

    * Network connection:

      Connect the Ethernet cable to your local network with DHCP enabled to install packages and run Jupyter Notebooks

3. Power on the board, and boot the Linux image.

    The Linux image will boot into the following login prompt:

    `xilinx-k26-starterkit-2020_2 login:`

    Use the `petalinux` user for login. You will be prompted to set a new password
    on the first login.

    ```
    xilinx-k26-starterkit-2020_2 login: petalinux
    You are required to change your password immediately (administrator enforced)
    New password:
    Retype new password:
    ```

    The `petalinux` user does not have root privileges. Most commands used in subsequent tutorials have to be run using `sudo` and you may be prompted to enter your password.

    **Note:** The root user is disabled by default due to security reasons. If you want to login as root user, follow the below steps, else, ignore this step and continue. Use the petalinux user's password on the first password prompt, then set a new password for the root user. You can now login as root user using the newly set root user password.

    ```
    xilinx-k26-starterkit-2020_2:~$ sudo su -l root

    We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
    Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

        #1) Respect the privacy of others.
        #2) Think before you type.
        #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

    Password:
    root@xilinx-k26-starterkit-2020_2:~# passwd
    New password:
    Retype new password:
    passwd: password updated successfully
    ```

4.  Get the latest application package.

    1.  Get the list of available packages in the feed.

        ```
        sudo xmutil getpkgs
        ```

    2.  Install the package with dnf install:

        ```
        sudo dnf install packagegroup-kv260-aibox-reid.noarch
        ```

        System will ask "Is this ok [y/N]:" to download the packages, please type "y" to proceed.

      Note: For setups without access to the internet, it is possible to download and use the package locally. Please refer to the [Install from a local package feed](../../local_package_feed.md) for instructions.

5.  Dynamically load the application package.

    The firmware consist of bitstream, device tree overlay (dtbo) and xclbin file. The firmware is loaded dynamically on user request once Linux is fully booted. The xmutil utility can be used for that purpose.

    1. Shows the list and status of available acceleration platforms and AI Applications:

        ```
        sudo xmutil      listapps
        ```
    2.  Switch to a different platform for different AI Application:

        * When xmutil listapps reveals that no accelerator is currently active, just activate kv260-aibox-reid:

            ```
            sudo xmutil      loadapp kv260-aibox-reid
            ```
        * When xmutil listapps reveals that there's already another accelerator being activated apart from kv260-aibox-reid, unload it first, then switch to kv260-aibox-reid.

            ```
            sudo xmutil      unloadapp
            sudo xmutil      loadapp kv260-aibox-reid
            ```

# How to run the application:

## Two types of input sources

The AIBOX application is targeted to run with RTSP streams as input source, but for convienience, we also support video files as input.

We assume the RTSP or video file to be **1080P H264/H265**

   * RTSP source <a name="rtsp-source"> </a>

     IP cameras normally have a configuration page to configure the RTSP stream related parameters. Please refer to the manual of your camera, and configure it to **1080P H264/H265**, and get the RTSP URL to be used as input parameter for the AIBox application. The URL is in the form of "rtsp://user:passwd@ip-address:port/name"


   * File source

      To demonstrate the application in the case where no IP camera is available, a video source may be played from a file on the SD card instead.
      You can download video files from the following links, which is of MP4 format.

      * https://pixabay.com/videos/liverpool-people-couple-pier-head-46090/
      * https://pixabay.com/videos/liverpool-pier-head-england-uk-46098/
      * https://pixabay.com/videos/spring-walk-park-trees-flowers-15252/
      * https://pixabay.com/videos/walking-people-city-bucharest-6099/

      Then you need to transcode it to H264 file which is the supported input format.

      ```
      ffmpeg -i input-video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt nv12 -vf scale=1920:1080 -r 30 output.nv12.h264
      ```
      Finally, please upload or copy these transcoded H264 files to the board, place it to somewhere under /home/petalinux, which is the home directory of the user you login as.

## Interacting with the application

There are two ways to interact with application, via Jupyuter notebook or Command line

### Jupyter notebook

  To launch Jupyter notebook on the target, run below command. Use Chrome web-browser to interact with the platform.
```
$ jupyter-lab --ip=ip-address &
// fill in ip-address from ifconfig
```
Output example:
```
xilinx-SOM-multi-cc-2020_2:~$ jupyter-lab --ip=xxx.xx.x.xxx &
[1] 1530
xilinx-SOM-multi-cc-2020_2:~$ [W 15:31:44.879 LabApp] JupyterLab server extension not enabled, manually loading...
[I 15:31:44.905 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 15:31:44.906 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /usr/share/jupyter/lab
[I 15:31:44.927 LabApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /opt/xilinx/share/notebooks
[I 15:31:44.928 LabApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
[I 15:31:44.928 LabApp] http://xxx.xx.x.xxx:8888/?token=635db1d645eeccc6a72bf1bb9c125164b1d689696348c97f
[I 15:31:44.928 LabApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=635db1d645eeccc6a72bf1bb9c125164b1d689696348c97f
[I 15:31:44.928 LabApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 15:31:44.952 LabApp]

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-1531-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://xxx.xx.x.xxx:8888/?token=635db1d645eeccc6a72bf1bb9c125164b1d689696348c97f
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=635db1d645eeccc6a72bf1bb9c125164b1d689696348c97f
```

In case user has started Jupyter-lab by running another Application supported on KV260 Vision AI Starter kit, user may skip the above step and does not need to restart.
In case user closes Chrome browser and need to find URL for Jupyter lab, run below command

```
$ sudo jupyter notebook list 
```
Output example:

> Currently running servers:
>
> `http://ip:port/?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`  :: /opt/xilinx/share/notebooks

In the notebook, we will construct the GStreamer pipeline string, you can get it by adding simple python code to print it out, and played with gst-launch-1.0 command in the console, and there are some user options variables that can be changed and run with. For other parts of the pipeline, you can also change and play to see the effect easily.

**Note** [Known limitation](issue-aib.md#notebook-one-channel)

### Command Line

**Note** The application needs to be run with ***sudo*** .

#### Examples:

   * Run one channel RTSP stream
      > sudo aibox-reid -s [rtsp://username:passwd@ip_address:port/name](#rtsp-source) -t rtsp -p 0
      or
      > sudo aibox-reid -s [rtsp://username:passwd@ip_address:port](#rtsp-source) -t rtsp -p 0

   * Run one channel video file
      > sudo aibox-reid -s /tmp/movies/shop.nv12.30fps.1080p.h264 -t file -p 1

   * Run multiple channels
     > sudo aibox-reid -s [rtsp://username:passwd@ip_address:port/name](#rtsp-source) -t rtsp -p 2 -s /tmp/movies/shop.nv12.30fps.1080p.h264 -t file -p 1

   **Note** Only one instance of aibox-reid application can run at a time because it requires exclusive access to a DPU engine and there is only one instance of DPU that exists in the aibox-reid platform.
