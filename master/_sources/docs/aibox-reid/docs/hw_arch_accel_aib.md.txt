# Pre-processing IPs and DPU

The Vitis&trade; software platform overlay includes the pre-processing IPs and DPU.

The pre-processing block as shown in the figure below includes the following functions:

![preprocess](../../media/preprocess_aib.png)

* Cvtcolor: Reads an NV12 video frame and converts the color format to BGR
* Resizing: Scales down the original 4K/1080p frame to at most 720x720
* Crop: Extracts the region of interest (ROI) from the input image.
* Quantizing: Performs linear transformation (scaling and shifting) to each pixel of BGR frame to satisfy DPU input requirement

The desgin uses Vitis Vision Library functions to build the pre-processing block. The Vitis functions used are, cvtcolor, resize, and blobfromimage.

The DPU IP as shown in the figure below  can be configured.

![DPU](../../media/dpu_aib.png)

For this design, the following features should be enabled:

* Channel augmentation
* Depth-wise convolution
* Average pooling
* Relu, LeakyRelu and Relu6
* URAM enable

To learn more about the DPU, please refer the [PG338](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/dpu/v3_2/pg338-dpu.pdf)

Vitis integrates the pre-processing IP and DPU IP in the platform. The table below shows utilization numbers after optimization of the hardware design.

**Resource usage of current design**

K26|CLB LUTs|BRAM|DSP|URAM|
|----|----|---|----|--|
|Available|117120|144|1248|64|
|Platform|21815|38|34|0|
|Pre-processing|11013|15|37|0|
|DPU B3136|43319|67|548|44|
|Other*|2721|0|0|0|
|Total|78848|120|619|44|
|Total %|67.32%|83.33%|49.60%|68.75%|

Other* : AXI interconnects and Interrupt concat block added by Vitis


The table below shows estimated DPU performance and overall power on the K26 chip (including 4K based pre-processing and other IPs). The DPU runs at 275MHz/550MHz.

**DPU performance and power (estimated)**

||TOPS (Peak)|TOPS (DenseBox)1|Power (Overall)
|-|-|-|-|
|B3136|0.92|0.25|7.9W


**Note:**

1. We use DenseBox_640x360 model to estimate the real performance of DPU, and this model has 1.1GOPs;
2. We can only estimate the overall power of K26 chip (including DPU and other IPs)

DPU B3136 bandwidth estimates are shown in the table below

**DPU B3136 bandwidth estimates**

|Operation||Refinedet_pruned_0.96|Densebox_640*360|reid
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Write MB/S|Peak|2772|1313|3099
||Average|668|447|110
|Read MB/S|Peak|2479|6279|5255
||Average|1155|2643|3211
