This document lists the known issues with the Defect Detection Application.

* System is not intelligent enough to identify whether the input is a mango. Therefore, pass only mangoes as input.
* Input to system must only be one mango at a time.
* Background should be black.
* Any live capture input source is not supported in this release.
* While closing the application, you may encounter the following error: 
  `[drm:zocl_xclbin_ctx [zocl]] *ERROR* try to add/remove CTX with wrong xclbin 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`. 
  This error does not affect functionality.
* You may see the following error the very first time you run any pipeline:
  `** (gst-plugin-scanner:1376): CRITICAL **: 10:30:56.784: Couldn't g_module_open libpython. Reason: /usr/lib/libpython3.7m.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`. 
  This error does not affect functionality.

* Jupyter lab does not have permission to write checkpoints into /opt/xilinx/share/notebooks

[W 17:24:13.478 LabApp] Permission denied: defect-detect/.ipynb_checkpoints
```

* This design has been validated only with 1280x800 resolution. 

Defect detection algorithm is evolving and will be updated in further releases. The present algorithm has the following limitations:

* For some mangoes, significant defects in the mango are not detected by the current defect detection algorithm. 
* For some mangoes, edges are being detected as defects.
