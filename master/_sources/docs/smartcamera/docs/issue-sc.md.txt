# Known Issues

* Monitor should be connected properly to the board before power on, otherwise the resolution will not be recognized correctly.

* The "-R" option of smartcam application for reporting FPS doesn't print any info when the target "-t" is RTSP.

* The latency of the data path to HDMI/DP display is above 100ms which is not optimal and will be improved in future.

* After invoking the command `xmutil loadapp` to load firmware, it needs several seconds for the whole firmware to be ready. If you invoke the smartcam application before it is ready, it may report errors about device readiness.

* When using VLC to play the RTSP stream sent out by the application, sometimes it doesn't work on some client machines, while the FFplay works well.

* When exercising the I2S Audio path in pass through mode the audio may have noise. This is because the clock frequency received by the audio clock is incorrect. To fix this issue update to the latest firmware (bin file) from the [KV260 wiki Page](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/1641152513). Instructions on how to update the firmware is also provided on the wiki page. 

  The other option is overwrite the clock setting before testing the Audio path. Note: This needs to be done everytime you boot into Linux

* Jupyter notebook only supports MIPI/USB input, and DP/RTSP output.

* Jupyter lab does not have permission to write checkpoints into /opt/xilinx/share/notebooks
